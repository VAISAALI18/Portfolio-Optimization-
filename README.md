# Stock Portfolio Optimization

This project provides a streamlined way to analyze stock data, calculate metrics like expected return and risk, and optimize portfolios using concepts like the Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and fractional knapsack algorithm. The app uses a binary search tree (BST) to efficiently sort and display stocks based on their expected return.

## Features

- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Download historical stock data using Yahoo Finance.
- **Metrics Calculation**: Analyze expected return, risk, Sharpe Ratio, and Treynor Ratio for each stock.
- **Portfolio Optimization**:
  - Sort stocks by expected return using a Binary Search Tree (BST).
  - Apply the fractional knapsack algorithm to maximize expected return within a given risk capacity.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate bar plots for expected return, risk, Sharpe Ratio, and Treynor Ratio.
- **Streamlit UI**: Interactive and user-friendly interface for selecting stocks and input parameters.
